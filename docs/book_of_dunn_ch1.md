# Chapter 1. What is Dunn?
## In the Beginning
In the beginning there were [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) chat rooms. The chosen few would hover around
their green computer screens and type comical and cryptic messages to each other long into the night.

However it wasn't long before the need to accomplish greater task arrived. Some
wanted to query the web. Others wanted to see when the last time a friend was in
the room. Still others were on the endless quest for the greatest troll.

Out of these tumultuous times was born the venerable [IRC Bot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat_bot).

## iRobot
IRC Bots needed to be many things. They needed to be ever present. They needed
to be database connected. They needed to be able to query a webservice. But most
importantly they needed to be hackable.

## Our Hero
And in this context we present DunnBot. Dunn is a modern, connected, and hip IRC
Bot. He's got a friendly api for creating plugins and is [licensed appropriately](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
